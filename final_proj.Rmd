**Analyze mass and reclass (material) and see if there is any correlation between the two**

```{r}

```

**Analyze year to see when impacts have occurred. If multiple meteorites hit within a relatively close timeframe, it could imply they may come from the same source.**

```{r}

```

**analyze and plot location of meteorite landings to see where has been most impacted**
